# pandas-challenge
This project is a part of the Module 4 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics BootCamp and is written entirely by the author of the repository. This README template is from the [Data Science Working Group](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg/blob/f1625aba8ac51ad90ec008f8ebc5ca1c42b304d7/dswg_project_resources/Project-README-template.md). 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of student test scores and the respective student's school identification information to understand trends in the data. In practice, this project could be effective for strategically advising a school board or district officials on budget allocation, school zone decisions, cirriculum, etc.

### Methods Used
* Summary Statistics
* Measures of Central Tendencies

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from Mockaroo, a data generator useful for demoing new software. This limits the data analysis to entirely hypothetical for the arbitrary city of PyCity; although, this particular district could benefit significantly from cirriculum and school spending modifications. The primary statistical methods used in the project are metrics of central tendency and comparison, yet the project lacks visualizations. Thus, data visualization presents a potential future direction for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept "PyCitySchools/Resources" within this repo.    
3. Jupyter Notebook script and analysis text are being kept "PyCitySchools".
4. Analysis Images taken from jupyter notebook are being kept "Images".
